## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Boston College Junior Studying Business Analytics and Information Systems

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a multi-agent AI trading system (Signalâ†’Riskâ†’Exec) and an FDIC market-intel bot using Python, Parquet/DuckDB, Vertex AI, and n8n.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PyTorch and machine learning end-to-end (time-series modeling, SFT/RL, and production-grade data engineering).

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source agentic AI frameworks, quant research tooling, and small-biz automation.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with low-latency data pipelines, PyTorch performance tuning, rigorous backtesting/validation, and CI/CD (Docker + GitHub Actions).
