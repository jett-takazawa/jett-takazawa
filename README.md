## Hi there 👋
I am a Boston College Junior Studying Business Analytics and Information Systems

I love expressing data driven analysis by expressing creative ideas and AI integration!



🔭 I’m currently working on building automated trading systems with implicit GEN AI.

🌱 I’m currently learning PyTorch (time-series modeling, SFT/RL, and production-grade data engineering).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on quant research, business automation, RAG LLM integration.

🤔 I’m looking for help with low-latency data pipelines, PyTorch performance tuning, and Docker + GitHub Actions.





Feel free to shoot me an email at:
jett.takazawa@gmail.com 

If you have found any interest in any of my projects!
